	abstract = {Picocyanobacteria make up half of the ocean’s primary production, and they are subjected to frequent viral infection. Viral lysis of picocyanobacteria is a major driving force converting biologically ﬁxed carbon into dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Viral-induced dissolved organic matter (vDOM) released from picocyanobacteria provides complex organic matter to bacterioplankton in the marine ecosystem. In order to understand how picocyanobacterial vDOM are transformed by bacteria and the impact of this process on bacterial community structure, viral lysate of picocyanobacteria was incubated with coastal seawater for 90 days. The transformation of vDOM was analyzed by ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and the shift of bacterial populations analyzed using high-throughput sequencing technology. Addition of picocyanobacterial vDOM introduced abundant nitrogen components into the coastal water, which were largely degraded during the 90 days’ incubation period. However, some DOM signatures were accumulated and the total assigned formulae number increased over time. In contrast to the control (no addition of vDOM), bacterial community enriched with vDOM changed markedly with increased biodiversity indices. The network analysis showed that key bacterial species formed complex relationship with vDOM components, suggesting the potential correspondence between bacterial populations and DOM molecules. We demonstrate that coastal bacterioplankton are able to quickly utilize and transform lysis products of picocyanobacteria, meanwhile, bacterial community varies with changing chemodiverisity of DOM. vDOM released from picocyanobacteria generated a complex labile DOM pool, which was converted to a rather stable DOM pool after microbial processing in the time frame of days to weeks.},

	abstract = {Unraveling the relative importance of ecological processes regulating microbial community structure is a central goal in microbial ecology. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to examine the relative contribution of selective and neutral processes in the assembly of abundant and rare subcommunities from three subtropical bays of China. We found that abundant and rare bacterial taxa were distinctly different in diversity, despite the similar biogeographic patterns and strong distance-decay relationships, but the dispersal of rare bacterial taxa was more limited than that of abundant taxa. Furthermore, the environmental (selective processes) and spatial (neutral processes) factors seemed to govern the assembly and biogeography of abundant and rare bacterial subcommunities, although both factors explained only a small fraction of variation within the rare subcommunity. More importantly, variation partitioning (based on adjusted R2 in redundancy analysis) showed that spatial factors exhibited a slightly greater inﬂuence on both abundant and rare subcommunities compared to environmental selection; however, the abundant subcommunity had a much stronger response to spatial factors (17.3\% of pure variance was explained) than that shown by the rare bacteria (3.5\%). These results demonstrate that environmental selection and neutral processes explained the similar biogeographic patterns of abundant and rare subcommunities, but a large proportion of unexplained variation in the rare taxa (91.1\%) implies that more complex assembly mechanisms may exist to shape the rare bacterial assemblages in the three subtropical bays.},

	abstract = {With strong horizontal gradients in physical properties, oceanic frontal regions can lead to disproportionately high biological productivity. We examined cross-frontal changes in mesopelagic ﬁsh assemblages at three separate frontal systems in the southern California Current Ecosystem (CCE) as part of the CCE Long Term Ecological Research program: the A-Front sampled in October 2008, the C-Front in June/July 2011, and the EFront in July/August 2012. We analyzed the diﬀerential eﬀects of front-associated regions on density and species composition of adult migratory and non-migratory ﬁshes and larvae, and the larval to adult ratio (as a possible index of a population growth potential) for migratory and non-migratory species. The fronts did not have a strong eﬀect on densities of any subset of the mesopelagic ﬁsh assemblage. The species composition of the vertical migratory ﬁshes (and their larvae) was typically altered across fronts, with diﬀerent assemblages present on either side of each front. The migratory assemblages at the fronts themselves were indistinguishable from those at the more productive side of the frontal system. In contrast, the assemblage composition of the nonmigratory ﬁshes was indistinguishable between regions across all three of the fronts. The diﬀerences between the Northern and Southern assemblages at the A-Front were primarily based on biogeographic provinces, while the assemblages at the E-Front were largely distinguishable by their oceanic or coastal-upwelling zone associations. These results generally conﬁrm those of previous studies on frontal systems in the California Current Ecosystem and elsewhere. The ratio of larvae to adults, a potential index of population growth potential, was altered across two of the fronts for migratory species, elevated on the colder side of the A-Front and the warmer side of the EFront. This ﬁnding suggests that fronts may be regions of enhanced reproduction. The larvae to adult ratio was indistinguishable for non-migratory species at all three frontal systems. The non-migratory component of the community was little inﬂuenced by the presence of a front, apparently because the regions of strongest horizontal spatial gradients were too shallow to be experienced directly. We speculate that there was no change in larval community composition and population growth index at the most dynamic frontal system (C-Front) compared to the other fronts surveyed because the frontal feature was short-lived relative to the time scale for population growth of the ﬁsh. However, the diﬀerence in results of the C-Front may also be due to a change in methodology used in this study. If mesoscale features such as fronts increase in frequency oﬀ the California coast in the future as predicted, they have the potential to alter population growth potential and restructure mesopelagic ﬁsh assemblages, which are dominated by migratory species.},

Experiments with 1µm latex beads showed that Cyclidium, Halteria, Dysteria, Aspidisca and Vorticella are bacterivores. Examination of food vacuole contents showed that the ciliate communities also included herbivores, carnivores, omnivores and mixotrophs. While some herbivorous ciliates grazed picoplanktonic algae or flagellates, large omnivores such as Frontonia and Linostoma ingested cyanobacterial filaments or preyed on other ciliates. Most predaceous ciliates were haptorids, and consumed other ciliates or metazoa. Growth rate estimates for planktonic ciliate populations in East African lakes ranged from 0.18 to 6.56d–1. From these growth rates and biomass, the estimated production of ciliate populations ranged from 5.9 to 2 335µg carbon l–1 d–1 and increased with lake trophic status and water electrical conductivity. Bacterivores, herbivores, carnivores and mixotrophs accounted for 36\%, 39\%, 21\% and 4\% of total production, respectively, over all the lakes. Zooplankton were the probable consumers of much of this ciliate production, although some taxa were consumed mostly within the microzooplankton community, presumably by other ciliates.},

	abstract = {Based on a sample of individuals, we focus on inferring the vector of species relative abundance of an entire assemblage and propose a novel estimator of the complete species-rank abundance distribution (RAD). Nearly all previous estimators of the RAD use the conventional ‘‘plug-in’’ estimator pˆi (sample relative abundance) of the true relative abundance pi of species i. Because most biodiversity samples are incomplete, the plug-in estimators are applied only to the subset of species that are detected in the sample. Using the concept of sample coverage and its generalization, we propose a new statistical framework to estimate the complete RAD by separately adjusting the sample relative abundances for the set of species detected in the sample and estimating the relative abundances for the set of species undetected in the sample but inferred to be present in the assemblage. We ﬁrst show that pˆi is a positively biased estimator of pi for species detected in the sample, and that the degree of bias increases with increasing relative rarity of each species. We next derive a method to adjust the sample relative abundance to reduce the positive bias inherent in pˆi. The adjustment method provides a nonparametric resolution to the longstanding challenge of characterizing the relationship between the true relative abundance in the entire assemblage and the observed relative abundance in a sample. Finally, we propose a method to estimate the true relative abundances of the undetected species based on a lower bound of the number of undetected species. We then combine the adjusted RAD for the detected species and the estimated RAD for the undetected species to obtain the complete RAD estimator. Simulation results show that the proposed RAD curve can unveil the true RAD and is more accurate than the empirical RAD. We also extend our method to incidence data. Our formulas and estimators are illustrated using empirical data sets from surveys of forest spiders (for abundance data) and soil ciliates (for incidence data). The proposed RAD estimator is also applicable to estimating various diversity measures and should be widely useful to analyses of biodiversity and community structure.},

Given the disparity in scales at which these factors operate, incorporating multiple spatial and temporal scales is necessary. In this study, we determined the relative importance of 3 groups of environmental drivers at diﬀerent scales (sediment, geomorphology, and oceanography) on epibenthic megafauna on a deep temperate continental shelf in the eastern Gulf of Maine (northwest Atlantic). Twenty benthic photographic transects (range: 611–1021 m; total length surveyed: 18,902 m; 996 images; average of 50 ± 16 images per transect) were performed in July and August 2009 to assess the abundance, composition and diversity of these communities. Surﬁcial geology was assessed using seaﬂoor imagery processed with a novel approach based on computer vision. A bathymetric terrain model (horizontal resolution: 100 m) was used to derive bathymetric variability in the vicinity of transects (1.5, 5 km). Oceanography at the seaﬂoor (temperature, salinity, current speed, current direction) over 10 years (1999–2008) was determined using empirical (World Ocean Database 2013) and modelled data (Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model; 45 vertical layers; horizontal resolution: 1.7–9.5 km). The relative inﬂuence of environmental drivers diﬀered between community traits. Abundance was enhanced primarily by swift current speeds, while higher diversity was observed in coarser and more heterogeneous substrates. In both cases, the role of geomorphological features was secondary to these drivers. Environmental variables were poor predictors of change in community composition at the scale of the eastern Gulf of Maine. This study demonstrated the need for explicitly incorporating scales into habitat modelling studies in these regions, and targeting speciﬁc drivers for community traits of interest.},

We also discuss how recent advances in microbial ecology have provided information about the potential interactions in distributed co‑occurrence and metabolic networks in oxygen minimum zones, and we provide new insights into coupled biogeochemical processes in the ocean.},

We analysed surface and deep-sea plankton samples from different oceanic regions, including the water-column in the Marmara Sea. We retrieved a large diversity of diplonemid phylotypes, most of which formed two novel distinct clades without cultured representatives. Although most marine diplonemid phylotypes appeared to be cosmopolitan, they showed a marked stratiﬁed distribution through the water column, being very scarce or absent in surface waters. The small and speciﬁc diplonemid diversity found in surface samples and the fact that most sequences of uncultured diplonemids found in other studies came from deep-sea environments suggest that the two major uncultured diplonemid clades group species preferentially inhabit the deep ocean.},

OMZ formation is often fueled by high surface primary production, and sinking organic particles can be hotspots of interactions and activity within microbial communities. This study investigated the diversity of OMZ protist communities in two biomass size fractions ({\textgreater}30 and 30–1.6 μm filters) from the world’s largest permanent OMZ in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific. Diversity was quantified via Illumina MiSeq sequencing of V4 region of 18S SSU rRNA genes in samples spanning oxygen gradients at two stations. Alveolata and Rhizaria dominated the two size fractions at both sites along the oxygen gradient. Community composition at finer taxonomic levels was partially shaped by oxygen concentration, as communities associated with versus anoxic waters shared only ∼32\% of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) (97\% sequence identity) composition. Overall, only 9.7\% of total OTUs were recovered at both stations and under all oxygen conditions sampled, implying structuring of the eukaryotic community in this area. Size-fractionated communities exhibited different taxonomical features (e.g. Syndiniales Group I in the 1.6–30 μm fraction) that could be explained by the microniches created on the surface-originated sinking particles.},

	abstract = {Molecular surveys are revealing diverse eukaryotic assemblages in oxygen-limited ocean waters. These communities may play pivotal ecological roles through autotrophy, feeding, and a wide range of symbiotic associations with prokaryotes. We used 18S rRNA gene sequencing to provide the ﬁrst snapshot of pelagic microeukaryotic community structure in two cellular size fractions (0.2–1.6 µm, {\textgreater}1.6 µm) from seven depths through the anoxic oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) off northern Chile. Sequencing of {\textgreater}154,000 amplicons revealed contrasting patterns of phylogenetic diversity across size fractions and depths. Protist and total eukaryote diversity in the {\textgreater}1.6 µm fraction peaked at the chlorophyll maximum in the upper photic zone before declining by ∼50\% in the OMZ. In contrast, diversity in the 0.2–1.6 µm fraction, though also elevated in the upper photic zone, increased four-fold from the lower oxycline to a maximum at the anoxic OMZ core. Dinoﬂagellates of the Dinophyceae and endosymbiotic Syndiniales clades dominated the protist assemblage at all depths (∼40–70\% of sequences). Other protist groups varied with depth, with the anoxic zone community of the larger size fraction enriched in euglenozoan ﬂagellates and acantharean radiolarians (up to 18 and 40\% of all sequences, respectively). The OMZ 0.2–1.6 µm fraction was dominated (11–99\%) by Syndiniales, which exhibited depth-speciﬁc variation in composition and total richness despite uniform oxygen conditions. Metazoan sequences, though conﬁned primarily to the 1.6 µm fraction above the OMZ, were also detected within the anoxic zone where groups such as copepods increased in abundance relative to the oxycline and upper OMZ. These data, compared to those from other low-oxygen sites, reveal variation in OMZ microeukaryote composition, helping to identify clades with potential adaptations to oxygen-depletion.},

	abstract = {Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), located below highly productive marine regions, are sites of microbially mediated denitriﬁcation and biogeochemical cycling that have global signiﬁcance. The intensity of OMZs ﬂuctuates naturally; however, the degree of these ﬂuctuations and a comprehensive understanding of the factors that drive these ﬂuctuations on decadal to centennial time scales is lacking. Our high-resolution (near-annual) record of δ15Nsed from laminated sediments at the Pescadero Slope in the Gulf of California (eastern tropical North Paciﬁc) ﬂuctuates between maximum values of 10.5‰ and minimum values of 8.0‰ over the past 1200 years. An analysis of the relationship between δ15NO3À and [O2] in the water column suggests that the observed range of δ15Nsed values is equivalent to an approximately 8 μM ﬂuctuation in O2 content and that these changes can occur in less than 25 years. Our ﬁndings show that the OMZ typically intensiﬁes quickly and contracts gradually; the average rate of OMZ intensiﬁcation (À0.24 μM O2/yr) is twice as fast as the rate of OMZ reoxygenation. Spectral analyses of the δ15Nsed record and Br/Cl counts, with the latter are used as a proxy for organic carbon preservation, suggest that the Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation and the Suess (deVries) solar cycle (solar irradiance) may inﬂuence the intensity of the OMZ and carbon production/export during the late Holocene. Coherence between δ15Nsed and weight percent organic carbon also suggests that similar mechanisms inﬂuence both OMZ ﬂuctuations and variation in organic carbon production/export.},

	abstract = {Climate models with biogeochemical components predict declines in oceanic dissolved oxygen with global warming. In coastal regimes oxygen deﬁcits represent acute ecosystem perturbations. Here, we estimate dissolved oxygen differences across the global tropical and subtropical oceans within the oxygen minimum zone (200–700-dbar depth) between 1960–1974 (an early period with reliable data) and 1990–2008 (a recent period capturing ocean response to planetary warming). In most regions of the tropical Paciﬁc, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans the oxygen content in the 200–700-dbar layer has declined. Furthermore, at 200 dbar, the area with O2 o 70 mmol kgÀ1, where some large mobile macro-organisms are unable to abide, has increased by 4.5 million km2. The tropical low oxygen zones have expanded horizontally and vertically. Subsurface oxygen has decreased adjacent to most continental shelves. However, oxygen has increased in some regions in the subtropical gyres at the depths analyzed. According to literature discussed below, ﬁshing pressure is strong in the open ocean, which may make it difﬁcult to isolate the impact of declining oxygen on ﬁsheries. At shallower depths we predict habitat compression will occur for hypoxia-intolerant taxa, with eventual loss of biodiversity. Should past trends in observed oxygen differences continue into the future, shifts in animal distributions and changes in ecosystem structure could accelerate.},

	abstract = {In the world’s oceans, even relatively low oxygen levels inhibit anaerobic nitrogen cycling by free-living microbes. Sinking organic aggregates, however, might provide oxygen-depleted microbial hotspots in otherwise oxygenated surface waters. Here, we show that sinking diatom aggregates can host anaerobic nitrogen cycling at ambient oxygen levels well above the hypoxic threshold. Aggregates were produced from the ubiquitous diatom Skeletonema marinoi and the natural microbial community of seawater. Microsensor proﬁling through the center of sinking aggregates revealed internal anoxia at ambient 40\% air saturation (∼100 µmol O2 L−1) and below. Accordingly, anaerobic nitrate turnover inside the aggregates was evident within this range of ambient oxygen levels. In incubations with 15N-labeled nitrate, individual Skeletonema aggregates produced NO2− (up to 10.7 nmol N h−1 per aggregate), N2 (up to 7.1 nmol N h−1), NH4+ (up to 2.0 nmol N h−1), and N2O (up to 0.2 nmol N h−1). Intriguingly, nitrate stored inside the diatom cells served as an additional, internal nitrate source for dinitrogen production, which may partially uncouple anaerobic nitrate turnover by diatom aggregates from direct ambient nitrate supply. Sinking diatom aggregates can contribute directly to ﬁxed-nitrogen loss in low-oxygen environments in the ocean and vastly expand the ocean volume in which anaerobic nitrogen turnover is possible, despite relatively high ambient oxygen levels. Depending on the extent of intracellular nitrate consumption during the sinking process, diatom aggregates may also be involved in the long-distance export of nitrate to the deep ocean.},

However, no information is available on the contribution this group makes to the prokaryote assemblages that inhabit the eastern South Paciﬁc Ocean. Here, we describe the relative abundance and vertical distribution of planktonic Archaea off northern and central-southern Chile. Data come from several cruises and a 45-month time series at a station located on the shelf off central-southern Chile. Both the taxonomic composition of the prokaryote community and its relative abundance were determined using quantitative dot blot 16S-rRNA hybridizations. Total Archaea in central-southern Chile made up 6–87\% of the prokaryote rRNA in the water column and did not present evidence of any seasonal pattern. Crenarchaea were the most abundant archaeal group at this site and were signiﬁcantly associated with the ammonium concentration (r2 ¼ 0.16, p ¼ 0.0003, n ¼ 80). Archaeal abundance in the time series was usually greater in the deeper layer (450 m), with contributions reaching up to \$90\% of the prokaryote rRNA on certain occasions, and decreasing towards the surface. Important increments in the relative abundance of total Archaea were observed on given dates at the surface of the time-series station off central-southern Chile. Off northern Chile, total Archaea normally contributed from \$10\% to 50\% of the prokaryote rRNA found between 10 and 1000 m, and were generally important in the mesopelagic realm. Our results indicate that Archaea constitute an important fraction of the prokaryote assemblage in the water column of the Humboldt Current System, especially in the oxygen minimum zone.},

But OMZs are also keys to understanding the present unbalanced nitrogen cycle and the oceans’ role on atmospheric greenhouse control. OMZs are the main areas of nitrogen loss (as N2, N2O) to the atmosphere through denitriﬁcation and anammox, and could even indirectly mitigate the oceanic biological sequestration of CO2. It was recently hypothesized that OMZs are going to spread in the coming decades as a consequence of global climate change. Despite an important OMZ role for the origin of marine life and for the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen, there are some key questions on the structure of OMZs at a global scale. There is no agreement concerning the threshold in oxygen that deﬁnes an OMZ, and the extent of an OMZ is often evaluated by denitriﬁcation criteria which, at the same time, are O2-dependent.},

Nitrite maxima and nitrate deﬁcits indicated the presence of denitrifying prokaryotic biomass within ETSP ODZs, and deep secondary ﬂuorescence maxima at the upper ODZ boundaries of 10 stations also suggested the presence of low-light, autotrophic communities. ODZs were observed as far west as 998W, more than 2300 km from the South American coast, where eolian lithogenic and lateral/resuspended sedimentary inputs were negligible, presenting a unique opportunity to examine prokaryotic metal stoichiometries. ODZ particulate P maxima can rival gyre mixed layer biomass concentrations, are highly sensitive to oxygen, and are in excess of amounts scavengable by local Fe oxyhydroxides and acid–volatile sulﬁdes. Even after correction for lithogenic and ferruginous–scavenged metals, ODZ P-maxima are often enriched in Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, V, and Zn, exhibiting particulate trace metal ratios to P that exceed mixed layer biomass ratios by factors of 2–9. ODZ prokaryotic communities may be largely hidden, TM–rich pools involved in the marine cycles of these bioactive trace metals.},

Samples were taken along a transect across the tropical Atlantic, along the equatorial upwelling and into the West-African upwelling region. Samples were collected as deep as 7000 m in the Romanche Fracture Zone within the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Approximately 50–70\% of FISH-identiﬁed eukaryotes in deep water masses belong to one of seven groups: kinetoplastids, labyrinthulomycetes, fungi, diplonemids, group II alveolates, MAST 4 (stramenopiles), and an unidentiﬁed organism with a peculiar nuclear morphology. A smaller percentage of total eukaryotes was identiﬁed in the Central Water, especially in the oxygen minimum zone, than in deep water masses. CARD-FISH probes designed to identify broad taxonomic groups revealed kinetoplastids and fungi were more abundant than noted in previous studies employing 18S rRNA gene clone libraries. Group II alveolates, in contrast, were much less prevalent than previously reported. On a second survey, eukaryotic microbes were enumerated in the deep-sea basins below the North Atlantic subtropical gyre including the Vema Fracture Zone, which is another prominent trench in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

This process was examined by comparing NH4+ rates of change during dark incubations, with and without the addition of allylthiourea, a classical inhibitor of the ammonia monooxygenase enzyme of ammonium-oxidizing bacteria. The contribution of aerobic NH+4 oxidation in dark carbon ﬁxation and NOÀ2 rates of change were also explored. Thirteen samples were retrieved from the oxycline (252 to p5 mM O2; 15 to \$65 m depth) and three from the oxygen minimum core (p5 mM O2; 100–200 m depth). Aerobic NH+4 oxidation rates were mainly detected in the upper part (15–30 m depth) of the oxycline, with rates ranging from 0.16 to 0.79 mM dÀ1, but not towards the oxycline base (40–65 m depth). In the oxygen minimum core, aerobic NH+4 oxidation was in the upper range and higher than in the upper part of the oxycline (0.70 and 1.0 mM dÀ1). Carbon ﬁxation rates through aerobic NH4+ oxidation ranged from 0.18 to 0.43 mg C LÀ1 dÀ1 and contributed between 33\% and 57\% of the total dark carbon ﬁxation, mainly towards the oxycline base and, in a single experiment, in the upper part of the oxycline. NO2À consumption was high (up to 10 mM dÀ1) towards the oxycline base and OMZ core, but was signiﬁcantly reduced in experiments amended with allylthiourea, indicating that aerobic NH+4 oxidation could contribute between 8\% and 76\% of NO2À production, which in turn could be available for denitriﬁers. Overall, these results support the important role of aerobic NH4+ oxidizers in the nitrogen and carbon cycling in the OMZ and at its upper boundary.},

Marine lakes provide an ideal comparative system, as they range from well-mixed holomictic lakes to stratified, anoxic, meromictic lakes that vary in their vertical extent of anoxia. We examined microbial communities inhabiting six marine lakes and one ocean site using pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Microbial richness and evenness was typically highest in the anoxic monimolimnion of meromictic lakes, with common marine bacteria present in mixolimnion communities replaced by anoxygenic phototrophs, sulfatereducing bacteria and SAR406 in the monimolimnion. These sharp changes in community structure were linked to environmental gradients (constrained variation in redundancy analysis 5 68\%–76\%) –particularly oxygen and pH. However, in those lakes with the steepest oxygen gradients, salinity and dissolved nutrients were important secondary constraining variables, indicating that subtle but substantive differences in microbial communities occur within similar low-oxygen habitats. Deterministic processes were a dominant influence on whole community assembly (all nearest taxon index values {\textgreater}4), demonstrating that the strong environmental gradients present in meromictic marine lakes drive microbial community assembly.},

	abstract = {The prasinophyte order Mamiellales contains several widespread marine picophytoplankton ( 2 lm diameter) taxa, including Micromonas and Ostreococcus. Complete genome sequences are available for two Micromonas isolates, CCMP1545 and RCC299. We performed in silico analyses of nitrogen transporters and related assimilation genes in CCMP1545 and RCC299 and compared these with other green lineage organisms as well as Chromalveolata, fungi, bacteria, and archaea. Phylogenetic reconstructions of ammonium transporter (AMT) genes revealed divergent types contained within each Mamiellales genome. Some were afﬁliated with plant and green algal AMT1 genes and others with bacterial AMT2 genes. Land plant AMT2 genes were phylogenetically closer to archaeal transporters than to Mamiellales AMT2 genes. The Mamiellales represent the ﬁrst green algal genomes to harbor AMT2 genes, which are not found in Chlorella and Chlamydomonas or the chromalveolate algae analyzed but are present in oomycetes. Fewer nitrate transporter (NRT) than AMT genes were identiﬁed in the Mamiellales. NRT1 was found in all but CCMP1545 and showed highest similarity to Mamiellales and proteobacterial NRTs. NRT2 genes formed a bootstrap-supported clade basal to other green lineage organisms. Several nitrogen-related genes were colocated, forming a nitrogen gene cluster. Overall, RCC299 showed the most divergent suite of nitrogen transporters within the various Mamiellales genomes, and we developed TaqMan quantitative polymerase chain reaction primer–probes targeting a subset of these, as well as housekeeping genes, in RCC299. All those investigated showed expression either under standard growth conditions or under nitrogen depletion. Like other recent publications, our ﬁndings show a higher degree of ‘‘mixed lineage gene afﬁliations’’ among eukaryotes than anticipated, and even the most phylogenetically anomalous versions appear to be functional. Nitrogen is often considered a regulating factor for phytoplankton populations. This study provides a springboard for exploring the use and functional diversiﬁcation of inorganic nitrogen transporters and related genes in eukaryotic phytoplankton.},

The OMZ of the eastern Atlantic is not suboxic and has relatively high oxygen minimum values of about 17 lmol kgÀ1 in the South Atlantic and more than 40 lmol kgÀ1 in the North Atlantic. About 20 (40\%) of the North Paciﬁc volume is occupied by an OMZ when using 45 lmol kgÀ1 (or 90 lmol kgÀ1, respectively) as an upper bound for OMZ oxygen concentration for ocean densities lighter than rh {\textless} 27.2 kg mÀ3. The relative volumes reduce to less than half for the South Paciﬁc (7\% and 13\%, respectively). The abundance of OMZs are considerably smaller (1\% and 7\%) for the South Atlantic and only \$0\% and 5\% for the North Atlantic. Thermal domes characterized by upward displacements of isotherms located in the northeastern Paciﬁc and Atlantic and in the southeastern Atlantic are co-located with the centres of the OMZs.

Previous delineations of hypoxic environments focus on those in enclosed seas where hypoxia may be exacerbated by anthropogenically induced eutrophication. Permanently hypoxic water masses in the open ocean, referred to as oxygen minimum zones, impinge on a much larger seaﬂoor surface area along continental margins of the eastern Paciﬁc, Indian and western Atlantic Oceans. We provide the ﬁrst global quantiﬁcation of naturally hypoxic continental margin ﬂoor by determining upper and lower oxygen minimum zone depth boundaries from hydrographic data and computing the area between the isobaths using seaﬂoor topography. This approach reveals that there are over one million km2 of permanently hypoxic shelf and bathyal sea ﬂoor, where dissolved oxygen is o0.5 ml lÀ1; over half (59\%) occurs in the northern Indian Ocean. We also document strong variation in the intensity, vertical position and thickness of the OMZ as a function of latitude in the eastern Paciﬁc Ocean and as a function of longitude in the northern Indian Ocean. Seaﬂoor OMZs are regions of low biodiversity and are inhospitable to most commercially valuable marine resources, but support a fascinating array of protozoan and metazoan adaptations to hypoxic conditions.},

Here, we report sections of dissolved cobalt and labile dissolved cobalt from the US GEOTRACES GP16 transect in the South Paciﬁc. The cobalt distribution is closely tied to the extent and intensity of the oxygen minimum zone in the eastern South Paciﬁc with highest concentrations measured at the oxycline near the Peru margin. Below 200 m, remineralization and circulation produce an inverse relationship between cobalt and dissolved oxygen that extends throughout the basin. Within the oxygen minimum zone, elevated concentrations of labile cobalt are generated by input from coastal sources and reduced scavenging at low O2. As these high cobalt waters are upwelled and advected offshore, phytoplankton export returns cobalt to low-oxygen water masses underneath. West of the Peru upwelling region, dissolved cobalt is less than 10 pM in the euphotic zone and strongly bound by organic ligands. Because the cobalt nutricline within the South Paciﬁc gyre is deeper than in oligotrophic regions in the North and South Atlantic, cobalt involved in sustaining phytoplankton productivity in the gyre is heavily recycled and ultimately arrives from lateral transport of upwelled waters from the eastern margin. In contrast to large coastal inputs, atmospheric deposition and hydrothermal vents along the East Paciﬁc Rise appear to be minor sources of cobalt. Overall, these results demonstrate that oxygen biogeochemistry exerts a strong inﬂuence on cobalt cycling.},

	abstract = {Photorespiration and oxygenic photosynthesis are intimately linked processes. It has been shown that under the present day atmospheric conditions cyanobacteria and all eukaryotic phototrophs need functional photorespiration to grow autotrophically. The question arises as to when this essential partnership evolved, i.e. can we assume a coevolution of both processes from the beginning or did photorespiration evolve later to compensate for the generation of 2-phosphoglycolate (2PG) due to Rubisco’s oxygenase reaction? This question is mainly discussed here using phylogenetic analysis of proteins involved in the 2PG metabolism and the acquisition of different carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs). The phylogenies revealed that the enzymes involved in the photorespiration of vascular plants have diverse origins, with some proteins acquired from cyanobacteria as ancestors of the chloroplasts and others from heterotrophic bacteria as ancestors of mitochondria in the plant cell. Only phosphoglycolate phosphatase was found to originate from Archaea. Notably glaucophyte algae, the earliest branching lineage of Archaeplastida, contain more photorespiratory enzymes of cyanobacterial origin than other algal lineages or land plants indicating a larger initial contribution of cyanobacterial-derived proteins to eukaryotic photorespiration. The acquisition of CCMs is discussed as a proxy for assessing the timing of periods when photorespiratory activity may have been enhanced. The existence of CCMs also had marked influence on the structure and function of photorespiration. Here, we discuss evidence for an early and continuous coevolution of photorespiration, CCMs and photosynthesis starting from cyanobacteria via algae, to land plants.},

Sediment samples were retrieved by a multiple corer at six stations along a depth transect (70–1025 m water depth) at 12◦ S, covering anoxic and hypoxic bottom water conditions. Benthic N2 ﬁxation, determined by the acetylene reduction assay, was detected at all sites, with highest rates between 70 and 253 m and lower rates at greater depth. SR rates decreased with increasing water depth. N2 ﬁxation and SR overlapped in sediments, suggesting a potential coupling of both processes. However, a weak positive correlation of their activity distribution was detected by principle component analysis. A potential link between N2 ﬁxation and sulfate-reducing bacteria was indicated by the molecular analysis of nifH genes. Detected nifH sequences clustered with the sulfate-reducing bacteria Desulfonema limicola at the 253 m station. However, nifH sequences of other stations clustered with uncultured organisms, Gammaproteobacteria, and Firmicutes (Clostridia) rather than with known sulfate reducers. The principle component analysis revealed that benthic N2 ﬁxation in the Peruvian OMZ is controlled by organic matter (positive) and free sulﬁde (negative). No correlation was found between N2 ﬁxation and ammonium concentrations (even at levels {\textgreater} 2022 µM). N2 ﬁxation rates in the Peruvian OMZ sediments were in the same range as those measured in other organic-rich sediments.},

	abstract = {Anammox is the anaerobic oxidation of ammonium by nitrite or nitrate to yield N2. This process, along with conventional denitriﬁcation, contributes to nitrogen loss in oxygen-deﬁcient systems. Anammox is performed by a special group of bacteria belonging to the Planctomycetes phylum. However, information about the distribution, activity, and controlling factors of these anammox bacteria is still limited. Herein, we examine the phylogenetic diversity, vertical distribution, and activity of anammox bacteria in the coastal upwelling region and oxygen minimum zone off northern Chile. The phylogeny of anammox bacteria was studied using primers designed to speciﬁcally target 16S rRNA genes from Planctomycetes in samples taken during a cruise in 2004. Anammox bacteria-like sequences afﬁliated with Candidatus ‘‘Scalindua spp.’’ dominated the 16S rRNA gene clone library. However, 62\% of the sequences subgrouped separately within this cluster and together with a single sequence retrieved from the suboxic zone of the freshwater Lake Tanganyika. The vertical distribution and activity of anammox bacteria were explored through CARD-FISH (ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization with catalyzed reporter deposition) and 15N labeling incubations, respectively, at two different open-ocean stations during a second cruise in 2005. Anammox bacterial CARD-FISH counts (up to 3000 cells mlÀ1) and activity (up to 5.75 nmol N2 LÀ1 dÀ1) were only detected at the station subjected directly to the upwelling inﬂuence. Anammox cell abundance and activity were highest at 50 m depth, which is the upper part of the OMZ. In this layer, a high abundance of cyanobacteria and a marked nitrogen deﬁcit were also observed. Thus, our results show the presence of a new subcluster within the marine anammox phylogeny and indicate high vertical variability in the abundance and activity of anammox bacteria that could be related to an intensiﬁcation of carbon and nitrogen cycling in the upper part of the OMZ.},

These new calculations estimate the total area and volume of the oxygen minimum zone to be 9.8273.60 Â 106 km2 and 2.1870.66 Â 106 km3, respectively. The oxygen minimum zone is thickest (4600 m) off Peru between 5 and 131S and to about 1000 km offshore. Its upper boundary is shallowest (o150 m) off Peru, shoaling towards the coast and extending well into the euphotic zone in some places. Offshore, the thickness and meridional extent of the oxygen minimum zone decrease until it ﬁnally vanishes at 1401W between 21 and 81S. Moving southward along the coast of South America, the zonal extension of the oxygen minimum zone gradually diminishes from 3000 km (151S) to 1200 km (201S) and then to 25 km (301S); only a thin band is detected at \$371S off Concepcio´ n, Chile. Simultaneously, the oxygen minimum zone’s maximum thickness decreases from 300 m (201S) to less than 50 m (south of 301S). The spatial distribution of Ekman suction velocity and oxygen minimum zone thickness correlate well, especially in the core. Off Chile, the eastern South Paciﬁc Intermediate Water mass introduces increased vertical stability into the upper water column, complicating ventilation of the oxygen minimum zone from above. In addition, oxygen-enriched Antarctic Intermediate Water clashes with the oxygen minimum zone at around 301S, causing a pronounced sub-surface oxygen front.

In this study, we investigated where and how much 15N or 34S were assimilated into foraminiferal cells or possible endobionts after incubation with isotopically labeled nitrate and sulfate in dysoxic or anoxic conditions. After 2 weeks of incubation, foraminiferal specimens were ﬁxed and prepared for Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and correlative nanometer-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) analyses. TEM observations revealed that there were characteristic ultrastructural features typically near the cell periphery in the youngest two or three chambers of the foraminifera exposed to anoxic conditions. These structures, which are electron dense and ∼200–500 nm in diameter and co-occurred with possible endobionts, were labeled with 15N originated from 15N-labeled nitrate under anoxia and were labeled with both 15N and 34S under dysoxia. The labeling with 15N was more apparent in specimens from the dysoxic incubation, suggesting higher foraminiferal activity or increased availability of the label during exposure to oxygen depletion than to anoxia. Our results suggest that the electron dense bodies in Ammonia sp. play a signiﬁcant role in nitrate incorporation and/or subsequent nitrogen assimilation during exposure to dysoxic to anoxic conditions.},

	abstract = {Zooplankton in the coastal upwelling region off northern Chile may play a signiﬁcant biogeochemical role by promoting carbon ﬂux into the subsurface OMZ (oxygen minimum zone). This work identiﬁes the dominant zooplankton species inhabiting the area inﬂuenced by the OMZ in March 2000 off Iquique (201S, northern Chile). Abundance and vertical distribution studies revealed 17 copepod and 9 euphausiid species distributed between the surface and 600 m at four stations sampled both by day and by night. Some abundant species remained in the well-oxygenated upper layer (30 m), with no evidence of diel vertical migration, apparently restricted by a shallow (40–60 m) oxycline. Other species, however, were found closely associated with the OMZ. The large-sized copepod Eucalanus inermis was found below the oxycline and performed diel vertical migrations into the OMZ, whereas the very abundant Euphausia mucronata performed extensive diel vertical migrations between the surface waters and the core of the OMZ (200 m), even crossing it. A complete assessment of copepods and euphausiids revealed that the whole sampled water column (0–600 m) is occupied by distinct species having well-deﬁned habitats, some of them within the OMZ. Ontogenetic migrations were evident in Eucalanidae and E. mucronata. Estimates of species biomass showed a substantial (475\% of total zooplankton biomass) daily exchange of C between the photic layer and the OMZ. Both E. inermis and E. mucronata can actively exchange about 37.8 g C mÀ2 dÀ1 between the upper well-oxygenated (0–60 m) layer and the deeper (60–600 m) OMZ layer. This migrant biomass may contribute about 7.2 g C mÀ2 dÀ1 to the OMZ system through respiration, mortality, and production of fecal pellets within the OMZ. This movement of zooplankton in and out of the OMZ, mainly as a result of the migratory behavior of E. mucronata, suggests a very efﬁcient mechanism for introducing large amounts of freshly produced carbon into the OMZ system and should, therefore, be considered when establishing C budgets for coastal upwelling systems.},

	abstract = {Connecting molecular information directly to microbial transformation rates remains a challenge, despite the availability of molecular methods to investigate microbial biogeochemistry. By combining information on gene abundance and expression for key genes with quantitative modeling of nitrogen ﬂuxes, we can begin to understand the scales on which genetic signals vary and how they relate to key functions. We used quantitative PCR of DNA and cDNA, along with biogeochemical modeling to assess how the abundance and expression of microbes responsible for two steps in the nitrogen cycle changed over time in estuarine sediment mesocosms. Sediments and water were collected from coastal Massachusetts and maintained in replicated 20 L mesocosms for 45 days. Concentrations of all major inorganic nitrogen species were measured daily and used to derive rates of nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation from a Monte Carlo-based non-negative least-squares analysis of ﬁnite difference equations. The mesocosms followed a classic regeneration sequence in which ammonium released from the decomposition of organic matter was subsequently oxidized to nitrite and then further to nitrate, some portion of which was ultimately denitriﬁed. Normalized abundances of ammonia oxidizing archaeal ammonia monoxoygenase (amoA) transcripts closely tracked rates of ammonia oxidation throughout the experiment. No such relationship, however, was evident between denitriﬁcation rates and the normalized abundance of nitrite reductase (nirS and nirK ) transcripts. These ﬁndings underscore the complexity of directly linking the structure of the microbial community to rates of biogeochemical processes.},

A total of 856 partial length 18S rDNA protistan sequences from the six clone libraries were analyzed to characterize diversity present at each depth. The sequences were grouped into a total of 259 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) that were inferred using an automated OTU calling program that formed OTUs with approximately species-level distinction (95\% sequence similarity). Most OTUs (194 out of 259) were observed at only one speciﬁc depth, and only two were present in clone libraries from all depths. OTUs were obtained from 21 major protistan taxonomic groups determined by their closest BLAST matches to identiﬁed protists in the NCBI database. Approximately 74\% of the detected OTUs belonged to the Chromalveolates, with Group II alveolates making up the largest single group. Protistan assemblages at euphotic depths (1.5, 20 and 42 m) were characterized by the presence of clades that contained phototrophic species (stramenopiles, chlorophytes and haptophytes) as well as consumers (especially ciliates). Assemblages in the lower water column (150, 500 and 800 m) were distinct from communities at shallow depths because of strong contributions from taxa belonging to euglenozoans, acantharians, polycystines and Taxopodida (Sticholonche spp. and close relatives). Species richness (Chao I estimate) and diversity (Shannon index) were highest within the euphotic zone and at 150 m, and lowest for protistan assemblages located in the oxygen minimum zone (500 and 880 m). Multivariate analyses (Bray–Curtis coefﬁcient) conﬁrmed that protistan assemblage composition differed signiﬁcantly when samples were grouped into shallow (r 150 m) and deep water assemblages (Z 150 m).},

Filled with high concentrations of hydrogen sulﬁde and ammonia, such a brine pool might limit the spread of eukaryotic organisms. Here, we compared the communities of the eukaryotic microbes in a microbial mat, sediments and water samples distributed in 7 sites within and adjacent to the brine pool. Taxonomic classiﬁcation of the pyrosequenced 18S rRNA amplicon reads showed that fungi highly similar to the species identiﬁed along the Arabic coast were almost ubiquitous in the water and sediment samples, supporting their wide distribution in various environments. The microbial mat displayed the highest species diversity and contained grazers and a considerable percentage of unclassiﬁed species. Phylogeny-based methods revealed novel lineages representing a majority of the reads from the interface between the sea water and brine pool. Phylogenetic relationships with more reference sequences suggest that the lineages were afﬁliated with novel Alveolata and Euglenozoa inhabiting the interface where chemosynthetic prokaryotes are highly proliferative due to the strong chemocline and halocline. The brine sediments harbored abundant species highly similar to invertebrate gregarine parasites identiﬁed in different oxygen-depleted sediments. Therefore, the present ﬁndings support the uniqueness of some microbial eukaryotic groups in this cold seep brine system.},

The macrobiota diversity in OMZs is low, but the fauna that do inhabit these regions present special adaptations to the low-oxygen conditions. Conversely, microbial communities in the OMZ water column and sediments are abundant and phylogenetically and metabolically very diverse, and microbial processes occurring therein (e.g., denitriﬁcation, anammox, and organic matter degradation) are important for global marine biogeochemical cycles. In this introductory article, we present the collection of papers for the special volume on the OMZ of the eastern South Paciﬁc, one of the three main open-ocean oxygen-deﬁcient regions of the global ocean.

Substantially lower values were found at the depths of the upper oxycline, where values varied from 2 to 33 nmol LÀ1 O2 hÀ1. Where secondary chlorophyll maxima were found the rates were higher than in the oxic water just above. Incubation times longer than 20 h, in the all-glass containers, resulted in highly increased respiration rates. Addition of amino acids to the water from the upper oxycline did not lead to a signiﬁcant initial rise in respiration rate within the ﬁrst 20 h, indicating that the measurement of respiration rates in oligotrophic Ocean water may not be severely affected by low levels of organic contamination during sampling. Our measurements indicate that aerobic metabolism proceeds efﬁciently at extremely low oxygen concentrations with apparent halfsaturation concentrations (Km values) ranging from about 10 to about 200 nmol LÀ1.},

	abstract = {The downward transport of surface particle production constitutes an important mechanism for carbon sequestration by the ocean. Only a small fraction (C10\%) of the ﬂux that leaves the euphotic zone reaches 1000 m depth because the particulate organic matter is consumed and transformed in the oceanic midwater column. The depth at which this transformation occurs is crucial to estimate carbon sequestration. Description of the particle ﬂux and remineralization with depth below the euphotic zone has previously been limited to empirical relationships that neglect physical and biological mechanisms. Because several particle properties and functions (settling speed, rates of coagulation and consumption) are related to particle size, measurements of particle size spectra provide an important tool to understand particle dynamics. Most of the mechanisms affecting particle dynamics known for the surface layer should continue in the mesopelagic region. We review the different mechanisms and formulate equations describing changes in particle size distributions throughout the water column as a result of particle sinking, coagulation, disaggregation, and bacterial and zooplankton consumption. The resulting model describes the midwater particle population by its mass distribution for the size range 1 mm to 1 cm. Most of the particle data sets have a narrower size range but we suggest that model results are not greatly affected by the lack of data on particles smaller than 200 mm because most of the particle mass is in particles larger than 100 mm, as seen in a full size-range particle spectrum. The combination of this model with a unique particle size spectra data set, obtained during an inter-annual survey at the French JGOFS site in the NW Mediterranean Sea, give an insight into the key processes for particle dynamics in the unknown midwater layers.},

	abstract = {During the past decade data from a variety of sources have been obtained which show conclusively that the relatively rare, large particles sinking through the water column are responsible for the majority of the downard vertical mass flux in the sea. This finding has important implications for understanding the transfer, distribution and fate of elements and organic compounds in marine waters. The "large" ( {\textgreater} 100 \#m) detrital particles responsible for vertical flux are primarily biogenic and range in size and composition from small, discrete fecal pellets and plankton hard parts to large, amorphous aggregates or "snow" which contain both organic and inorganic constitutents. Depending on size, shape and density, these particles sink at rates ranging from {\textless} 1 to {\textgreater} 1000 m day -t . Several methods have been developed for sampling these particles of which in situ sediment trapping has probably furnished the most comprehensive qualitative and quantitative information on the role large particles play in material transport. Flux studies have highlighted the importance of marine heterotrophs in packaging fine, suspended particulate matter into large rapidly sinking particles which accelerate the movement of incorporated materials to depth. Large particle production via biological packaging is not restricted to the euphotic zone but can occur at all depths and information is now accruing on rates of production of large particles in the water column. Chemical analyses of sedimenting particles collected in sediment traps and those sampled by other means have allowed quantifying vertical fluxes and residence times of elements, radionuclides and organic compounds (natural and anthropogenic) in various oceanic regimes. Pertinent studies dealing with the above aspects are reviewed and several areas for future research are suggested.},

	abstract = {Diatoms are a diverse and ecologically important group of phytoplankton. Although most species are considered free living, several are known to interact with other organisms within the plankton. Detailed imaging and molecular characterization of any such partnership is, however, limited, and an appraisal of the large-scale distribution and ecology of such consortia was never attempted. Here, observation of Tara Oceans samples from the Benguela Current led to the detection of an epibiotic association between a pennate diatom and a tintinnid ciliate. We identiﬁed the diatom as Fragilariopsis doliolus that possesses a unique feature to form barrel-shaped chains, associated with seven different genera of tintinnids including ﬁve previously undescribed associations. The organisms were commonly found together in the Atlantic and Paciﬁc Ocean basins, and live observations of the interaction have been recorded for the ﬁrst time. By combining confocal and scanning electron microscopy of individual consortia with the sequencing of high-resolution molecular markers, we analyzed their distribution in the global ocean, revealing morpho-genetically distinct tintinnid haplotypes and biogeographically structured diatom haplotypes. The diatom was among the most abundant in the global ocean. We show that the consortia were particularly prevalent in nutrient-replete conditions, rich in potential predators. These observations support the hypothesis of a mutualistic symbiosis, wherein diatoms acquire increased motility and tintinnids beneﬁt from siliciﬁcation through increased protection, and highlight that such associations may be more prevalent than currently appreciated.},

	abstract = {The mesopelagic zone is the oceanic region through which carbon and other elements must pass in order to reach deeper waters or the sea ﬂoor. However, the food web interactions that occur in the mesopelagic zone are difﬁcult to measure and so, despite their crucial importance to global elemental cycles, are not very well known. Recent developments in technology and new approaches have advanced the study of the variability in and controls upon the distribution and diversity of organisms in the mesopelagic zone, including the roles of respiration, recycling, and repackaging of particulate and dissolved organic material. However, there are remarkably few syntheses of the ecology and biogeochemistry of the microbes and metazoa that permanently reside or habitually visit this ‘twilight zone’. Without this synthesis, it is difﬁcult to assess the impact of ongoing changes in ocean hydrography and chemistry, due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, on the biological carbon pump. This paper reviews what is known about the distribution of microbes and metazoa in the mesopelagic zone in relation to their activity and impact on global biogeochemical cycles. Thus, gaps in our knowledge are identiﬁed and suggestions made for priority research programmes that will improve our ability to predict the effects of climate change on carbon sequestration.},

DGGE analysis and 18S rRNA gene clone libraries showed that this mesopelagic protist community was dynamic, with marked changes in taxonomic and functional community composition in different seasons. The most frequently recovered sequences in autumn were related to heterotrophic dinoflagellates. In late December 2003, an abrupt change in the community composition occurred following an influx of water from the lower Pacific halocline that flowed onto the Arctic continental shelf and into Franklin Bay. Subsequently, the most frequently retrieved sequences matched uncultured marine alveolates, which are thought to be primarily parasites. This community changed little over the winter, with modest changes in spring marked by the addition of taxa. Summer libraries from 2004 were once more dominated by dinoflagellate sequences with a community very similar to that at the end of autumn 2003. These summer and autumn communities corresponded to periods of higher phytoplankton sedimentation rates in the euphotic zone. We suggest that the deep protist community may reform annually in response to primary production higher in the water column and that the winter mesopelagic protist community is dynamically coupled to the deep offshore ocean.},

	abstract = {Here we assess the temperature dependence of the metabolic rates (gross primary production (GPP), community respiration (CR), and the ratio GPP/CR) of oceanic plankton communities. We compile data from 133 stations of the Malaspina 2010 Expedition, distributed among the subtropical and tropical Atlantic, Paciﬁc, and Indian oceans. We used the in vitro technique to measured metabolic rates during 24 h incubations at three different sampled depths: surface, 20\%, and 1\% of the photosynthetically active radiation measured at surface. We also measured the \% of ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) penetrating at surface waters. GPP and CR rates increased with warming, albeit different responses were observed for each sampled depth. The overall GPP/CR ratio declined with warming. Higher activation energies (Ea) were derived for both processes (GPPChla = 0.97; CRChla = 1.26; CRHPA = 0.95 eV) compared to those previously reported. The Indian Ocean showed the highest Ea (GPPChla = 1.70; CRChla = 1.48; CRHPA = 0.57 eV), while the Atlantic Ocean showed the lowest (GPPChla = 0.86; CRChla = 0.77; CRHPA = À0.13 eV). We believe that the difference between previous assessments and the ones presented here can be explained by the overrepresentation of Atlantic communities in the previous data sets. We found that UVB radiation also affects the temperature dependence of surface GPP, which decreased rather than increased under high levels of UVB. Ocean warming, which causes stratiﬁcation and oligotrophication of the subtropical and tropical oceans, may lead to reduced surface GPP as a result of increased penetration of UVB radiation.},

Diapycnal diffusivity (Kρ) was estimated from dissipation rates of turbulent kinetic energy (ε) measured by the MSS proﬁler, and also from hydrographic and meteorological data by using the K-proﬁle parameterization (KPP). In the mixing layer, averaged Kρ (169 Â 10 À 4 m2 s À 1) and ε (16:8 Â 10 À 8 W kg À 1) were three and one orders of magnitude higher, respectively, compared to the ocean interior (0:59 Â 10 À 4 m2 s À 1 and 1:0 Â 10 À 8 W kg À 1). In general, the KPP showed a good agreement with diffusivity estimates derived from microstructure observations, both in the mixing layer and in the ocean interior. The KPP also reproduced the main regional patterns observed in the ocean interior. The analysis of turbulence generation mechanisms below the mixing layer showed that shear-induced mixing was more important in those regions inﬂuenced by the equatorial undercurrent, where averaged diffusivity was 2:27–3:62 Â 10 À 4 m2 s À 1. Favorable conditions for salt ﬁngers formation were more frequently observed in the Atlantic, where, as a consequence of this process, diffusivity could increase up to 20\%. This result could have important implications for the transport of heat and dissolved substances in these regions.},

	abstract = {Establishing relationships between species distributions and environmental characteristics is a major goal in the search for forces driving species distributions. Canonical ordinations such as redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis are invaluable tools for modeling communities through environmental predictors. They provide the means for conducting direct explanatory analysis in which the association among species can be studied according to their common and unique relationships with the environmental variables and other sets of predictors of interest, such as spatial variables. Variation partitioning can then be used to test and determine the likelihood of these sets of predictors in explaining patterns in community structure. Although variation partitioning in canonical analysis is routinely used in ecological analysis, no effort has been reported in the literature to consider appropriate estimators so that comparisons between fractions or, eventually, between different canonical models are meaningful. In this paper, we show that variation partitioning as currently applied in canonical analysis is biased. We present appropriate unbiased estimators. In addition, we outline a statistical test to compare fractions in canonical analysis. The question addressed by the test is whether two fractions of variation are signiﬁcantly different from each other. Such assessment provides an important step toward attaining an understanding of the factors patterning community structure. The test is shown to have correct Type I error rates and good power for both redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis.},

This is a consequence of huge absolute population sizes rather than any inherent properties of particular taxonomic groups. At the local scale, the diversity of small species exceeds that of larger organisms, but at the global scale this relation is reversed, because endemism is largely responsible for the species richness of large organisms. For small organisms, the relationship between species and area is flat, and a latitudinal diversity gradient is absent or weak. These patterns are explained by some of the assumptions underlying the unified neutral community model.},

	abstract = {The deep marine subsurface is a vast habitat for microbial life where cells may live on geologic timescales. Because DNA in sediments may be preserved on long timescales, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is suggested to be a proxy for the active fraction of a microbial community in the subsurface. During an investigation of eukaryotic 18S rRNA by amplicon pyrosequencing, unique profiles of Fungi were found across a range of marine subsurface provinces including ridge flanks, continental margins, and abyssal plains. Subseafloor fungal populations exhibit statistically significant correlations with total organic carbon (TOC), nitrate, sulfide, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). These correlations are supported by terminal restriction length polymorphism (TRFLP) analyses of fungal rRNA. Geochemical correlations with fungal pyrosequencing and TRFLP data from this geographically broad sample set suggests environmental selection of active Fungi in the marine subsurface. Within the same dataset, ancient rRNA signatures were recovered from plants and diatoms in marine sediments ranging from 0.03 to 2.7 million years old, suggesting that rRNA from some eukaryotic taxa may be much more stable than previously considered in the marine subsurface.},

	abstract = {The last quarter century has seen dramatic changes in our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships among protist groups and their evolutionary history. This is due in large part to the maturation of molecular phylogenetics, to genomics and transcriptomics becoming widely used tools, and to ongoing and accelerating progress in characterizing the major lineages of protists in the biosphere. As an introduction to the Handbook of the Protists, Second Edition, we provide a brief account of the diversity of protistan eukaryotes, set within the context of eukaryote phylogeny as currently understood. Most protist lineages can be assigned to one of a handful of major groupings (“supergroups”). These include Archaeplastida (which also includes land plants), Sar (including Stramenopiles/Heterokonta, Alveolata, and Rhizaria), Discoba, Metamonada, Amoebozoa, and Obazoa. This last group in turn contains Opisthokonta, the clade that includes both animals and fungi. Many, but not all, of the deeperlevel phylogenetic relationships within these groups are now resolved. Additional well-known groups that are related to Archaeplastida and/or Sar include Cryptista (cryptophyte algae and their relatives), Haptophyta, and Centrohelida, among others. Another set of protist lineages are probably most closely related to Amoebozoa and Obazoa, including Ancyromonadida and perhaps Malawimonadidae (though the latter may well be more closely related to Metamonada). The bulk of the known diversity of protists is covered in the following 43 chapters of the Handbook of the Protists; here we also brieﬂy introduce those lineages that are not covered in later chapters.},

Thus, the total amount of prokaryotic carbon is 60–100\% of the estimated total carbon in plants, and inclusion of prokaryotic carbon in global models will almost double estimates of the amount of carbon stored in living organisms. In addition, the earth’s prokaryotes contain 85–130 Pg of N and 9–14 Pg of P, or about 10-fold more of these nutrients than do plants, and represent the largest pool of these nutrients in living organisms. Most of the earth’s prokaryotes occur in the open ocean, in soil, and in oceanic and terrestrial subsurfaces, where the numbers of cells are 1.2 ؋ 1029, 2.6 ؋ 1029, 3.5 ؋ 1030, and 0.25–2.5 ؋ 1030, respectively. The numbers of heterotrophic prokaryotes in the upper 200 m of the open ocean, the ocean below 200 m, and soil are consistent with average turnover times of 6–25 days, 0.8 yr, and 2.5 yr, respectively. Although subject to a great deal of uncertainty, the estimate for the average turnover time of prokaryotes in the subsurface is on the order of 1–2 ؋ 103 yr. The cellular production rate for all prokaryotes on earth is estimated at 1.7 ؋ 1030 cells͞yr and is highest in the open ocean. The large population size and rapid growth of prokaryotes provides an enormous capacity for genetic diversity.},

	abstract = {Viruses infecting prokaryotic cells (phages) are the most abundant entities of the biosphere and contain a largely uncharted wealth of genomic diversity. They play a critical role in the biology of their hosts and in ecosystem functioning at large. The classical approaches studying phages require isolation from a pure culture of the host. Direct sequencing approaches have been hampered by the small amounts of phage DNA present in most natural habitats and the difficulty in applying metaomic approaches, such as annotation of small reads and assembly. Serendipitously, it has been discovered that cellular metagenomes of highly productive ocean waters (the deep chlorophyll maximum) contain significant amounts of viral DNA derived from cells undergoing the lytic cycle. We have taken advantage of this phenomenon to retrieve metagenomic fosmids containing viral DNA from a Mediterranean deep chlorophyll maximum sample. This method allowed description of complete genomes of 208 new marine phages. The diversity of these genomes was remarkable, contributing 21 genomic groups of tailed bacteriophages of which 10 are completely new. Sequence based methods have allowed host assignment to many of them. These predicted hosts represent a wide variety of important marine prokaryotic microbes like members of SAR11 and SAR116 clades, Cyanobacteria and also the newly described low GC Actinobacteria. A metavirome constructed from the same habitat showed that many of the new phage genomes were abundantly represented. Furthermore, other available metaviromes also indicated that some of the new phages are globally distributed in low to medium latitude ocean waters. The availability of many genomes from the same sample allows a direct approach to viral population genomics confirming the remarkable mosaicism of phage genomes.},

	abstract = {Marine bacterioplankton dominate microbial carbon biomass in surface waters of the oligotrophic ocean, yet there have been few studies examining rates of change in bacterioplankton assemblage composition in situ over time and across water masses. Temporal changes in bacterioplankton assemblage composition were investigated during 7 drifter studies of 24 to 360 h duration in the oligotrophic Gulf of Mexico, the North Pacific and the West Tropical Atlantic in 2001 to 2003, using an assemblage fingerprinting technique, automated rRNA intergenic-spacer analysis (ARISA). The similarity indices between assemblages collected over time in the same drifter changed on average by a Sørensen index of 0.12 d-1 (comparing the presence/absence of operational taxonomic units, OTU) and a Whittaker index (comparing proportions in various OTU) of 0.17 d-1 per fingerprint, across all surface drifter studies. Fingerprints generated from 7 replicate bacterioplankton DNA samples collected at each of 2 stations were remarkably similar to each other, sharing a Whittaker index {\textgreater} 0.85. Despite this consistency over small spatial scales ({\textless} 2 km), no clear relationship was observed between the separation distance of sampling locations and similarity between assemblage fingerprints in the North Pacific and Atlantic gyres over mesoscales (10 to 3000 km), oscillating around a mean of 0.38 to 0.47 for each gyre. Our results suggest that factors ultimately shaping assemblage composition are localized at spatial scales between a few kilometers and about 50 km, i.e. this is a typical horizontal 'patch size', within which communities are relatively homogenous, perhaps because physical mixing (e.g. by eddies) may dominate over biological interactions. Our results also suggest that, while similar environmental factors may cause bacterioplankton assemblages to share a small portion of OTU between different sampling locations, biological factors selecting for particular bacterial types (e.g. viral lysis, grazing, antagonism, nutrition) may cause assemblage composition variability over short geographic distances.},

At concentrations of approximately 10 million viruses per milliliter of surface seawater, viruses are the most abundant biological entities in the oceans. The majority of these viruses are phages (viruses that infect bacteria). Through lysing their bacterial hosts, marine phages control bacterial abundance, affect community composition, and impact global biogeochemical cycles. In addition, phages inﬂuence their hosts through selection for resistance, horizontal gene transfer, and manipulation of bacterial metabolism. Recent work has also demonstrated that marine phages are extremely diverse and can carry a variety of auxiliary metabolic genes encoding critical ecological functions. This review is structured as a scientiﬁc “truth or dare,” revealing several well-established “truths” about marine viruses and presenting a few “dares” for the research community to undertake in future studies.},

	abstract = {Background: The analysis of microbial communities through DNA sequencing brings many challenges: the integration of different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, multivariate statistics, visualization and testing. With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data.
Results: Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research.
Conclusions: The phyloseq project for R is a new open-source software package, freely available on the web from both GitHub and Bioconductor.},

	abstract = {Archaea (archaebacteria) are a phenotypically diverse group of microorganisms that share a common evolutionary history. There are four general phenotypic groups of archaea: the methanogens, the extreme halophiles, the sulfate-reducing archaea, and the extreme thermophiles. In the marine environment, archaeal habitats are generally limited to shallow or deep-sea anaerobic sediments (free-living and endosymbiotic methanogens), hot springs or deep-sea hydrothermal vents (methanogens, sulfate reducers, and extreme thermophiles), and highly saline land-locked seas (halophiles). This report provides evidence for the widespread occurrence of unusual archaea in oxygenated coasl surface waters of North America. Quantitative mates indicated that up to 2\% of the total ribosomal RNA extracted fom coastal bacterioplankton assemblages was archaeal. Archaeal small-subunit ribosomal RNA-encoding DNAs (rDNAs) were coned from mixed bacterioplankton populations collected at geographically distant sampling sites. Phylogenetic and nucleotide signature analyses of these cloned rDNAs revealed the presence of two lin of archaea, each sharing the dinic signatures and structural features previously established for the domain Archaea. Both of these lineages were found in bacterioplankton populations collected off the east and west coass of North America. The abundance and distribution of these arcaea in oxic coastal surface waters suggests that these microorgnisms represent undescribed physiological types of arcaea, which reside and compete with aerobic, mesophilic eubacteria in marine coastal environments.},

	abstract = {The structure and diversity of bacterial communities associated with the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of the eastern tropical South Paciﬁc was studied through phylogenetic analysis. Clone libraries of 16S rRNA gene fragments were constructed using environmental DNA collected from the OMZ (60 m and 200 m), the sea surface (10 m), and the deep oxycline (450 m). At the class level, the majority of sequences affiliated to the g- (53.7\%) and a-Proteobacteria (19.7\%), and to the Bacteroidetes (11.2\%). A vertical partitioning of the bacterial communities was observed, with main differences between the suboxic OMZ and the more oxygenated surface and deep oxycline waters. At the surface, the microbial community was predominantly characterized by SAR86, Loktanella and unclassiﬁed Flavobacteriaceae, whereas the deeper layer was dominated by Sulﬁtobacter and unclassiﬁed Alteromonadaceae. In the OMZ, major constituents affiliated to the marine SAR11 clade and to thiotrophic g-symbionts (25\% of all sequences), a group not commonly found in pelagic waters. Sequences affiliating to the phylum Chloroﬂexi, to the AGG47 and SAR202 clades, to the d-Proteobacteria, to the Acidobacteria, and to the ‘anammox group’ of the Planctomycetes were found exclusively in the OMZ. The bacterial richness in the OMZ was higher than in the oxic surface and deeper oxycline, as revealed by rarefaction analysis and the Chao1 richness estimator (surface: 45 Ϯ 8, deeper oxycline: 76 Ϯ 26; OMZ60m: 97 Ϯ 33, OMZ200m: 109 Ϯ 31). OMZ bacterial diversity indices (Fisher’s: {\textasciitilde}30 Ϯ 5, Shannon’s: {\textasciitilde}3.31, inverse Simpson’s: {\textasciitilde}20) were similar to those found in other pelagic marine environments.},

	abstract = {Background: Copepods outnumber every other multicellular animal group. They are critical components of the world’s freshwater and marine ecosystems, sensitive indicators of local and global climate change, key ecosystem service providers, parasites and predators of economically important aquatic animals and potential vectors of waterborne disease. Copepods sustain the world fisheries that nourish and support human populations. Although genomic tools have transformed many areas of biological and biomedical research, their power to elucidate aspects of the biology, behavior and ecology of copepods has only recently begun to be exploited. Discussion: The extraordinary biological and ecological diversity of the subclass Copepoda provides both unique advantages for addressing key problems in aquatic systems and formidable challenges for developing a focused genomics strategy. This article provides an overview of genomic studies of copepods and discusses strategies for using genomics tools to address key questions at levels extending from individuals to ecosystems. Genomics can, for instance, help to decipher patterns of genome evolution such as those that occur during transitions from free living to symbiotic and parasitic lifestyles and can assist in the identification of genetic mechanisms and accompanying physiological changes associated with adaptation to new or physiologically challenging environments. The adaptive significance of the diversity in genome size and unique mechanisms of genome reorganization during development could similarly be explored. Genome-wide and EST studies of parasitic copepods of salmon and large EST studies of selected free-living copepods have demonstrated the potential utility of modern genomics approaches for the study of copepods and have generated resources such as EST libraries, shotgun genome sequences, BAC libraries, genome maps and inbred lines that will be invaluable in assisting further efforts to provide genomics tools for copepods. Summary: Genomics research on copepods is needed to extend our exploration and characterization of their fundamental biological traits, so that we can better understand how copepods function and interact in diverse environments. Availability of large scale genomics resources will also open doors to a wide range of systems biology type studies that view the organism as the fundamental system in which to address key questions in ecology and evolution.},

However, many microbial ecologists are still in the process of developing a deep understanding of these methods and appreciating their limitations. As a consequence, staying abreast of progress and debate in this arena poses an additional challenge to many microbial ecologists. To address these issues, we present the GUide to STatistical Analysis in Microbial Ecology (GUSTA ME): a dynamic, web-based resource providing accessible descriptions of numerous multivariate techniques relevant to microbial ecologists. A combination of interactive elements allows users to discover and navigate between methods relevant to their needs and examine how they have been used by others in the ﬁeld. We have designed GUSTA ME to become a community-led and -curated service, which we hope will provide a common reference and forum to discuss and disseminate analytical techniques relevant to the microbial ecology community.},

These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples.

Although stochastic processes are believed to play nonnegligible roles in shaping community structure, their importance relative to deterministic processes is hotly debated. The importance of ecological stochasticity in shaping microbial community structure is far less appreciated. Some of the main reasons for such heavy debates are the difﬁculty in deﬁning stochasticity and the diverse methods used for delineating stochasticity. Here, we provide a critical review and synthesis of data from the most recent studies on stochastic community assembly in microbial ecology. We then describe both stochastic and deterministic components embedded in various ecological processes, including selection, dispersal, diversiﬁcation, and drift. We also describe different approaches for inferring stochasticity from observational diversity patterns and highlight experimental approaches for delineating ecological stochasticity in microbial communities. In addition, we highlight research challenges, gaps, and future directions for microbial community assembly research.},

	abstract = {The abundance and distribution of species across the landscape depend on the interaction between local, spatial and stochastic processes. However, empirical syntheses relating these processes to spatio-temporal patterns of structure in metacommunities remains elusive. One important reason for this lack of synthesis is that the relative importance of the core assembly processes (dispersal, selection and drift) critically depends on the spatial grain and extent over which communities are studied. To illustrate this, we simulated different aspects of community assembly on heterogeneous landscapes, including the strength of response to environmental heterogeneity (inherent to niche theory) versus dispersal and stochastic drift (inherent to neutral theory). We show that increasing spatial extent leads to increasing importance of niche selection, whereas increasing spatial grain leads to decreasing importance of niche selection. The strength of these scaling effects depended on environment configuration, dispersal capacity and niche breadth. By mapping the variation observed from the scaling effects in simulations, we could recreate the entire range of variation observed within and among empirical studies. This means that variation in the relative importance of assembly processes among empirical studies is largely scale dependent and cannot be directly compared. The scaling coefficient of the relative contribution of assembly processes, however, can be interpreted as a scale-integrative estimate to compare assembly processes across different regions and ecosystems. This emphasizes the necessity to consider spatial scaling as an explicit component of studies intended to infer the importance of community assembly processes. This article is protected by copyright.

	abstract = {The world's oceans contain a complex mixture of micro-organisms that are for the most part, uncharacterized both genetically and biochemically. We report here a metagenomic study of the marine planktonic microbiota in which surface (mostly marine) water samples were analyzed as part of the Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling expedition. These samples, collected across a several-thousand km transect from the North Atlantic through the Panama Canal and ending in the South Pacific yielded an extensive dataset consisting of 7.7 million sequencing reads (6.3 billion bp). Though a few major microbial clades dominate the planktonic marine niche, the dataset contains great diversity with 85\% of the assembled sequence and 57\% of the unassembled data being unique at a 98\% sequence identity cutoff. Using the metadata associated with each sample and sequencing library, we developed new comparative genomic and assembly methods. One comparative genomic method, termed “fragment recruitment,” addressed questions of genome structure, evolution, and taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity, as well as the biochemical diversity of genes and gene families. A second method, termed “extreme assembly,” made possible the assembly and reconstruction of large segments of abundant but clearly nonclonal organisms. Within all abundant populations analyzed, we found extensive intra-ribotype diversity in several forms: (1) extensive sequence variation within orthologous regions throughout a given genome; despite coverage of individual ribotypes approaching 500-fold, most individual sequencing reads are unique; (2) numerous changes in gene content some with direct adaptive implications; and (3) hypervariable genomic islands that are too variable to assemble. The intra-ribotype diversity is organized into genetically isolated populations that have overlapping but independent distributions, implying distinct environmental preference. We present novel methods for measuring the genomic similarity between metagenomic samples and show how they may be grouped into several community types. Specific functional adaptations can be identified both within individual ribotypes and across the entire community, including proteorhodopsin spectral tuning and the presence or absence of the phosphate-binding gene PstS.},

We ﬁrst investigate issues related to its deﬁnition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

	abstract = {Disentangling the effects of dispersal and environmental heterogeneity on biodiversity is a central goal in ecology. Although metacommunity structure can be partitioned into spatial and environmental fractions, it remains unclear whether these statistical results can be used to infer the relative importance of dispersal limitation (spatial fraction) and environmental forcing (environmental fraction). Using an environmentally forced, spatially explicit metacommunity model, we show that the distinct effects of the mean (advection) and the standard deviation (diffusion) of the dispersal kernel on biodiversity are not easily detectable via variation partitioning alone. Although increasing dispersal ultimately leads to a decrease in the spatial fraction due to reduced dispersal limitation and greater species sorting, the magnitude of the spatial fraction depends on the complex interplay between the nature of dispersal and the type of boundary conditions in the metacommunity. Indeed, metacommunities characterized by either high or low dispersal can exhibit a small spatial fraction. A case study of a marine metacommunity experiencing strong alongshore transport is consistent with these ﬁndings, as the size of the spatial fraction is not associated with dispersal. Overall, our results suggest that accounting for the nature of environmental forcing as well as the multifactorial effects of dispersal is critical for understanding how ecological and environmental processes give rise to biodiversity across spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Metacommunity structure can be shaped by a variety of processes operating at different spatial scales. With increasing scale, the compositional variation among local communities (beta diversity) may reflect stronger environmental heterogeneity, but may also reflect reduced exchange of organisms between habitat patches. We analyzed the spatial architecture of a metacommunity of cladoceran zooplankton in temporary pools of High Andes wetlands, with the objective of explaining the spatial dependency of its structure. The spatial distribution of the pools is hierarchical and highly discontinuous: pools are clustered within small wetlands, which lay scattered over valleys that are separated from each other by mountain ridges. We studied a total of 59 pools, belonging to six different wetlands in four different valleys. We assessed pool environmental heterogeneity and sampled active communities and dormant propagule banks of cladoceran zooplankton. Environmental heterogeneity proved very high within wetlands and showed almost no increase with increasing spatial scale. Conversely, diversity partitioning analyses indicated an increase in beta diversity with spatial scale, especially among valleys. Variation partitioning on environmental data and spatial RDA models suggested environmental heterogeneity as the most important generator of beta diversity within wetlands. At the largest spatial scale, beta diversity manifested itself mainly as a differentiation of species occurrence patterns among valleys, which could not be entirely explained by environmental variables. Our study thus presents a case where environmental control seems to be the dominant metacommunity structuring process at the smallest spatial scale, whereas neutral processes and dispersal limitation are the most likely generators of beta diversity at the largest spatial scale.},

Using a metabarcoding dataset of marine plankton from the global ocean, 318,054 mixotrophic metabarcodes represented by 89,951,866 sequences and belonging to 133 taxonomic lineages were identiﬁed and classiﬁed into four mixotrophic functional types: constitutive mixotrophs (CM), generalist non-constitutive mixotrophs (GNCM), endo-symbiotic specialist non-constitutive mixotrophs (eSNCM), and plastidic specialist non-constitutive mixotrophs (pSNCM). Mixotrophy appeared ubiquitous, and the distributions of the four mixotypes were analyzed to identify the abiotic factors shaping their biogeographies. Kleptoplastidic mixotrophs (GNCM and pSNCM) were detected in new zones compared to previous morphological studies. Constitutive and non-constitutive mixotrophs had similar ranges of distributions. Most lineages were evenly found in the samples, yet some of them displayed strongly contrasted distributions, both across and within mixotypes. Particularly divergent biogeographies were found within endo-symbiotic mixotrophs, depending on the ability to form colonies or the mode of symbiosis. We showed how metabarcoding can be used in a complementary way with previous morphological observations to study the biogeography of mixotrophic protists and to identify key drivers of their biogeography.},

Volume and density contrast were computed. The measured mean weights ranged from 0.05 to 24 μg per shell. The values appear to be significantly greater than weights of preserved radiolarians from the bottom sediments, for which selective dissolution of many large species can account. The weight is best correlated with projected area among the dimensions of Radiolaria as a group. The density contrast of the skeletons relative to seawater generally falls between 0.01 and 0.5 g cm−3 and appears to be constant with an order-of-magnitude increase of the shell diameter. The sinking speeds of skeletal remains of 55 radiolarian species measured in 3, 10, and 20°C seawater range from 13 to 416 m day−3. Despite the wide variety of morphology, the sinking speed is best correlated with weight per shell, with reasonably small deviations from a regression line. The observed sinking speeds are generally lower than those predicted by Stokes Law and systematically deviate from it. Non-sphericity of the specimens can only partially account for the departure. Using the sinking speeds, residence times of the 55 species in the 5-km pelagic water column range from 2 weeks to 14 months. Judging from the residence time and vertical flux measurements, most polycystine Radiolaria appear to reach the bottom without substantial loss in their assemblages. Large phaeodarian radiolarians appear to reach the water-sediment interface relatively quickly and ultimately dissolve there. Small phaeodarians dissolve en route.},

The geostrophic currents in open-sea subsurface regime also show a seasonal cycle and there is some evidence that signatures of this cycle appear as deep as 1000m. The forcing due to Ekman suction is an important mechanism for the geostrophic currents in the central and western parts of the Sea.

It occurs among most, perhaps all, of the extant orders, including the Prorocentrales, Dinophysiales. Gymnodiniales, Noctilucales, Gonyaulacales, Peridiniales, Blastodiniales. Phytodiniales, and Dinamoebales. Many cases of mixotrophy among dinoflagellates are probably undocumented. Primarily photosynthetic dinoflagellates with their “own” plastids can often supplement their nutrition by preying on other cells. Some primarily phagotrophic species are photosynthetic due to the presence of kleptochloroplasts or algal endosymbionts. Some parasitic dinoflagellates have plastids and are probably mixotrophic. For most mixotrophic dinoflagellates, the relative importance of photosynthesis, uptake of dissolved inorganic nutrients, and feeding are unknown. However, it is apparent that mixotrophy has different functions in different physiological types of dinoflagellates. Data on the simultaneous regulation of photosynthesis, assimilation of dissolved inorganic and organic nutrients, and phagotophy by environmental parameters (irradiance. availablity of dissolved nutrients, availability of prey) and by life history events are needed in order to understand the diverse roles of mixotrophy in dinoflagellates.},

	abstract = {The dark ocean microbiota represents the unknown majority in the global ocean waters. The SAR202 cluster belonging to the phylum Chloroﬂexi was the ﬁrst microbial lineage discovered to speciﬁcally inhabit the aphotic realm, where they are abundant and globally distributed. The absence of SAR202 cultured representatives is a signiﬁcant bottleneck towards understanding their metabolic capacities and role in the marine environment. In this work, we use a combination of metagenome-assembled genomes from deep-sea datasets and publicly available single-cell genomes to construct a genomic perspective of SAR202 phylogeny, metabolism and biogeography. Our results suggest that SAR202 cluster members are medium sized, free-living cells with a heterotrophic lifestyle, broadly divided into two distinct clades. We present the ﬁrst evidence of vertical stratiﬁcation of these microbes along the meso- and bathypelagic ocean layers. Remarkably, two distinct species of SAR202 cluster are highly abundant in nearly all deep bathypelagic metagenomic datasets available so far. SAR202 members metabolize multiple organosulfur compounds, many appear to be sulﬁte-oxidizers and are predicted to play a major role in sulfur turnover in the dark water column. This concomitantly suggests an unsuspected availability of these nutrient sources to allow for the high abundance of these microbes in the deep sea.},

	abstract = {The downward transport of surface particle production constitutes an important mechanism for carbon sequestration by the ocean. Only a small fraction (C10\%) of the ﬂux that leaves the euphotic zone reaches 1000 m depth because the particulate organic matter is consumed and transformed in the oceanic midwater column. The depth at which this transformation occurs is crucial to estimate carbon sequestration. Description of the particle ﬂux and remineralization with depth below the euphotic zone has previously been limited to empirical relationships that neglect physical and biological mechanisms. Because several particle properties and functions (settling speed, rates of coagulation and consumption) are related to particle size, measurements of particle size spectra provide an important tool to understand particle dynamics. Most of the mechanisms affecting particle dynamics known for the surface layer should continue in the mesopelagic region. We review the different mechanisms and formulate equations describing changes in particle size distributions throughout the water column as a result of particle sinking, coagulation, disaggregation, and bacterial and zooplankton consumption. The resulting model describes the midwater particle population by its mass distribution for the size range 1 mm to 1 cm. Most of the particle data sets have a narrower size range but we suggest that model results are not greatly affected by the lack of data on particles smaller than 200 mm because most of the particle mass is in particles larger than 100 mm, as seen in a full size-range particle spectrum. The combination of this model with a unique particle size spectra data set, obtained during an inter-annual survey at the French JGOFS site in the NW Mediterranean Sea, give an insight into the key processes for particle dynamics in the unknown midwater layers.},

	abstract = {We recorded vertical profiles of size distributions of large particles (.100 mm) to a 1000-m depth in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans and in the Mediterranean Sea with the Underwater Video Profiler. Of the 410 profiles used in our analysis, 193 also included temperature, salinity, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-resolved pigments, which were used to characterize the size structure of the phytoplankton community. Classification analysis identified six clusters of vertical profiles of size distributions of particles. Each cluster was characterized by the size distribution of its particles in the mesopelagic layer and the change of the particle-size distribution with depth. Clusters with large particles in the mesopelagic layer corresponded to surface waters dominated by microphytoplankton, and those with small particles corresponded to surface waters dominated by picophytoplankton. We estimated the mass flux at 400 m using a relationship between particle size and mass flux. Principal-component regression analysis showed that 68\% of the variance of the mass flux at 400 m was explained by the size structure of the phytoplankton community and integrated chlorophyll a in the euphotic zone. We found that coefficient k in the Martin power relationship, which describes the decrease in the vertical mass flux with depth, varies between 0.2 and 1.0 in the world ocean, and we provided an empirical relationship to derive k from the size structure of phytoplankton biomass in the euphotic zone. Biogeochemists and modelers could use that relationship to obtain a realistic description of the downward particle flux instead of using a constant k value as often done.},

Here, we report a comprehensive comparison of bacterioplankton diversity between polar oceans, using standardized methods for pyrosequencing the V6 region of the small subunit ribosomal (SSU) rRNA gene. Bacterial communities from lower latitude oceans were included, providing a global perspective. A clear difference between Southern and Arctic Ocean surface communities was evident, with 78\% of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) unique to the Southern Ocean and 70\% unique to the Arctic Ocean. Although polar ocean bacterial communities were more similar to each other than to lower latitude pelagic communities, analyses of depths, seasons, and coastal vs. open waters, the Southern and Arctic Ocean bacterioplankton communities consistently clustered separately from each other. Coastal surface Southern and Arctic Ocean communities were more dissimilar from their respective open ocean communities. In contrast, deep ocean communities differed less between poles and lower latitude deep waters and displayed different diversity patterns compared with the surface. In addition, estimated diversity (Chao1) for surface and deep communities did not correlate significantly with latitude or temperature. Our results suggest differences in environmental conditions at the poles and different selection mechanisms controlling surface and deep ocean community structure and diversity. Surface bacterioplankton may be subjected to more short-term, variable conditions, whereas deep communities appear to be structured by longer water-mass residence time and connectivity through ocean circulation.},

	abstract = {A census of the biomass on Earth is key for understanding the structure and dynamics of the biosphere. However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ≈550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of ≈6 Gt C of marine biota, doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants.},

Copepoda, our focal taxonomic group, consistently dominated samples (∼80\% relative abundance). We report declines in zooplankton and copepod abundance with depth, concurrent with decreases in food availability. Taxonomic richness was lowest at depth and below the deep-scattering layer. In contrast, copepod diversity peaked at these depths, suggesting lower competitive displacement in these more food-limited waters. Finally, omnivory and carnivory, were the dominant trophic traits, each one affecting the biological carbon pump in a different way.

	abstract = {Rapid advances in molecular microbial ecology have yielded an unprecedented amount of data about the evolutionary relationships and functional traits of microbial communities that regulate global geochemical cycles. Biogeochemical models, however, are trailing in the wake of the environmental genomics revolution, and such models rarely incorporate explicit representations of bacteria and archaea, nor are they compatible with nucleic acid or protein sequence data. Here, we present a functional gene-based framework for describing microbial communities in biogeochemical models by incorporating genomics data to provide predictions that are readily testable. To demonstrate the approach in practice, nitrogen cycling in the Arabian Sea oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) was modeled to examine key questions about cryptic sulfur cycling and dinitrogen production pathways in OMZs. Simulations support previous assertions that denitrification dominates over anammox in the central Arabian Sea, which has important implications for the loss of fixed nitrogen from the oceans. Furthermore, cryptic sulfur cycling was shown to attenuate the secondary nitrite maximum often observed in OMZs owing to changes in the composition of the chemolithoautotrophic community and dominant metabolic pathways. Results underscore the need to explicitly integrate microbes into biogeochemical models rather than just the metabolisms they mediate. By directly linking geochemical dynamics to the genetic composition of microbial communities, the method provides a framework for achieving mechanistic insights into patterns and biogeochemical consequences of marine microbes. Such an approach is critical for informing our understanding of the key role microbes play in modulating Earth’s biogeochemistry.},

Although sinking particles are heavily colonized by microbes, so far it has not been explored whether this process plays a role in transferring prokaryotic diversity from surface to deep oceanic layers. Using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, we explore here the vertical connectivity of the ocean microbiome by characterizing marine prokaryotic communities associated with five different size fractions and examining their compositional variability from surface down to 4,000 m across eight stations sampled in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans during the Malaspina 2010 Expedition. Our results show that the most abundant prokaryotes in the deep ocean are also present in surface waters. This vertical community connectivity seems to occur predominantly through the largest particles because communities in the largest size fractions showed the highest taxonomic similarity throughout the water column, whereas free-living communities were more isolated vertically. Our results further suggest that particle colonization processes occurring in surface waters determine to some extent the composition and biogeography of bathypelagic communities. Overall, we postulate that sinking particles function as vectors that inoculate viable particle-attached surface microbes into the deep-sea realm, determining to a considerable extent the structure, functioning, and biogeography of deep ocean communities.},

In addition to the possibility of direct consumption of mesopelagic species, there is interest in their use for ﬁshmeal, as a source of dietary supplements for humans, and to bio-prospect pharmaceuticals. All of this, and the demands for a global food supply that can feed an ever-growing population, has driven interest in the mesopelagic. Thus, accurate quantiﬁcation of the biomass of mesopelagic resources, their nutritional and genetic composition, their links to other components of the food web, to other oceanic realms and to biological and chemical oceanographic processes and cycles, are the focus of growing research activity. This information is needed to ensure the sustainable management of these resources. In this introduction, we summarize the contributions included in this theme set and provide some “food for thought” on the state-of-the-art in research on the mesopelagic, including identifying the knowledge that must be generated to support its sustainable management (e.g. the effect that extracting signiﬁcant biomass might have on the pelagic ecosystem and the ﬂow of material and energy through it).},

For example, a five-year plan to deliver taxonomic and genomic knowledge on a thousand species in regions of the ocean earmarked for industrial activity is an achievable target. High-throughput, integrative taxonomy can, therefore, provide the data that is needed to monitor various ecosystem services (such as the natural history, connectivity, value and function of species) and to help break the regulatory deadlock of high-seas conservation.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen increased survey and sampling expeditions to the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), central Pacific Ocean abyss, driven by commercial interests from contractors in the potential extraction of polymetallic nodules in the region. Part of the International Seabed Authority (ISA) regulatory requirements are that these contractors undertake environmental research expeditions to their CCZ exploration claims following guidelines approved by the ISA Legal and Technical Commission (ISA, 2010). Section 9 (e) of these guidelines instructs contractors to “…collect data on the sea floor communities specifically relating to megafauna, macrofauna, meiofauna, microfauna, nodule fauna and demersal scavengers”. There are a number of methodological challenges to this, including the water depth (4000–5000 m), extremely warm surface waters ({\textasciitilde}28 °C) compared to bottom water ({\textasciitilde}1.5 °C) and great distances to ports requiring a large and long seagoing expedition with only a limited number of scientists. Both scientists and regulators have recently realized that a major gap in our knowledge of the region is the fundamental taxonomy of the animals that live there; this is essential to inform our knowledge of the biogeography, natural history and ultimately our stewardship of the region. Recognising this, the ISA is currently sponsoring a series of taxonomic workshops on the CCZ fauna and to assist in this process we present here a series of methodological pipelines for DNA taxonomy (incorporating both molecular and morphological data) of the macrofauna and megafauna from the CCZ benthic habitat in the recent ABYSSLINE cruise program to the UK-1 exploration claim. A major problem on recent CCZ cruises has been the collection of high-quality samples suitable for both morphology and DNA taxonomy, coupled with a workflow that ensures these data are made available. The DNA sequencing techniques themselves are relatively standard, once good samples have been obtained. The key to quality taxonomic work on macrofaunal animals from the tropical abyss is careful extraction of the animals (in cold, filtered seawater), microscopic observation and preservation of live specimens, from a variety of sampling devices by experienced zoologists at sea. Essential to the long-term iterative building of taxonomic knowledge from the CCZ is an “end-to-end” methodology to the taxonomic science that takes into account careful sampling design, at-sea taxonomic identification and fixation, post-cruise laboratory work with both DNA and morphology and finally a careful sample and data management pipeline that results in specimens and data in accessible open museum collections and online repositories.},

Here we use metaproteomics to chart spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression along defined redox gradients in a seasonally stratified fjord to better understand microbial community responses to OMZ expansion. The expression of metabolic pathway components for nitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), denitrification, and inorganic carbon fixation were differentially expressed across the redoxcline and covaried with distribution patterns of ubiquitous OMZ microbes including Thaumarchaeota, Nitrospina, Nitrospira, Planctomycetes, and SUP05/ARCTIC96BD-19 Gammaproteobacteria. Nitrification and inorganic carbon fixation pathways affiliated with Thaumarchaeota dominated dysoxic waters, and denitrification, sulfur oxidation, and inorganic carbon fixation pathways affiliated with the SUP05 group of nitrate-reducing sulfur oxidizers dominated suboxic and anoxic waters. Nitrifier nitrite oxidation and anammox pathways affiliated with Nirospina, Nitrospira, and Planctomycetes, respectively, also exhibited redox partitioning between dysoxic and suboxic waters. The numerical abundance of SUP05 proteins mediating inorganic carbon fixation under anoxic conditions suggests that SUP05 will become increasingly important in global ocean carbon and nutrient cycling as OMZs expand.},

	abstract = {Marine ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are among the most abundant of marine microorganisms, spanning nearly the entire water column of diverse oceanic provinces. Historical patterns of abundance are preserved in sediments in the form of their distinctive glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) membrane lipids. The correlation between the composition of GDGTs in surface sediment and the overlying annual average sea surface temperature forms the basis for a paleotemperature proxy (TEX86) that is used to reconstruct surface ocean temperature as far back as the Middle Jurassic. However, mounting evidence suggests that factors other than temperature could also play an important role in determining GDGT distributions. We here use a study set of four marine AOA isolates to demonstrate that these closely related strains generate different TEX86–temperature relationships and that oxygen (O2) concentration is at least as important as temperature in controlling TEX86 values in culture. All of the four strains characterized showed a unique membrane compositional response to temperature, with TEX86-inferred temperatures varying as much as 12 °C from the incubation temperatures. In addition, both linear and nonlinear TEX86–temperature relationships were characteristic of individual strains. Increasing relative abundance of GDGT-2 and GDGT-3 with increasing O2 limitation, at the expense of GDGT-1, led to significant elevations in TEX86-derived temperature. Although the adaptive significance of GDGT compositional changes in response to both temperature and O2 is unclear, this observation necessitates a reassessment of archaeal lipid-based paleotemperature proxies, particularly in records that span low-oxygen events or underlie oxygen minimum zones.},

Mixing and stirring by eddies exerts significant control on biogeochemical fluxes in the open ocean, and eddies may trap distinctive plankton communities that remain coherent for months and can be transported hundreds to thousands of kilometers. Debate regarding how and why predators use fronts and eddies, for example as a migratory cue, enhanced forage opportunities, or preferred thermal habitat, has been ongoing since the 1950s. The influence of eddies on the behavior of large pelagic fishes, however, remains largely unexplored. Here, we reconstruct movements of a pelagic predator, the blue shark (Prionace glauca), in the Gulf Stream region using electronic tags, earth-observing satellites, and data-assimilating ocean forecasting models. Based on {\textgreater}2,000 tracking days and nearly 500,000 high-resolution time series measurements collected by 15 instrumented individuals, we show that blue sharks seek out the interiors of anticyclonic eddies where they dive deep while foraging. Our observations counter the existing paradigm that anticyclonic eddies are unproductive ocean “deserts” and suggest anomalously warm temperatures in these features connect surface-oriented predators to the most abundant fish community on the planet in the mesopelagic. These results also shed light on the ecosystem services provided by mesopelagic prey. Careful consideration will be needed before biomass extraction from the ocean twilight zone to avoid interrupting a key link between planktonic production and top predators. Moreover, robust associations between targeted fish species and oceanographic features increase the prospects for effective dynamic ocean management.},

	abstract = {Phaeodaria, which comprise one group of large, single-celled eukaryotic zooplankton, have been largely ignored by past marine biological studies because Phaeodaria and their delicate skeletons are liable to collapse. As a result, collection and quantification of specimens are difficult, and seasonal changes of phaeodarian abundance have not been thoroughly studied. The transport of biogenic elements by sinking phaeodarians has been estimated for only a few representative species. Sinking particles {\textgreater}1 mm in size and swimmers have traditionally been excluded when estimating sinking particle fluxes. The focus of this study is the large number of phaeodarians among the {\textgreater}1-mm sinking particles collected in the western North Pacific from June 2014 to July 2015. Careful sorting by microscopic examination and chemical analyses revealed that phaeodarians accounted for up to about 10\% of the organic carbon in all sinking particles and accounted for a mean of 33\% of the organic carbon in the {\textgreater}1-mm sinking particles. The high-standing stocks of phaeodarians at depths of 150–1,000 m in the mesopelagic twilight zone suggested that particles sinking from the euphotic zone as aggregates and fecal pellets can be efficiently exported to the deep sea by the ballasting effect of large phaeodarian particles rich in organic carbon.},

We use six different aligners and five different variant callers to determine which pipeline, of the 30 total, performs the best on a human exome that was used to help generate the list of variants detected by the Genome in a Bottle Consortium. Of these 30 pipelines, we found that Novoalign in conjunction with GATK UnifiedGenotyper exhibited the highest sensitivity while maintaining a low number of false positives for SNVs. However, it is apparent that indels are still difficult for any pipeline to handle with none of the tools achieving an average sensitivity higher than 33\% or a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) higher than 53\%. Lastly, as expected, it was found that aligners can play as vital a role in variant detection as variant callers themselves.},

	abstract = {The free-living (FL) and particle-attached (PA) marine microbial communities have repeatedly been proved to differ in their diversity and composition in the photic ocean and also recently in the bathypelagic ocean at a global scale. However, although high taxonomic ranks exhibit preferences for a PA or FL mode of life, it remains poorly understood whether two clear lifestyles do exist and how these are distributed across the prokaryotic phylogeny. We studied the FL ({\textless}0.8 μm) and PA (0.8–20 μm) prokaryotes at 30 stations distributed worldwide within the bathypelagic oceanic realm (2150–4000 m depth) using high-throughput sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (16S rRNA). A high proportion of the bathypelagic prokaryotes were mostly found either attached to particles or freely in the surrounding water but rarely in both types of environments. In particular, this trait was deeply conserved through their phylogeny, suggesting that the deep-ocean particles and the surrounding water constitute two highly distinct niches and that transitions from one to the other have been rare at an evolutionary timescale. As a consequence, PA and FL communities had clear alpha- and beta-diversity differences that exceeded the global-scale geographical variation. Our study organizes the bathypelagic prokaryotic diversity into a reasonable number of ecologically coherent taxa regarding their association with particles, a first step for understanding which are the microbes responsible for the processing of the dissolved and particulate pools of organic matter that have a very different biogeochemical role in the deep ocean.},

	abstract = {Microbial eukaryotes are key components of the ocean plankton. Yet, our understanding of their community composition and activity in different water layers of the ocean is limited, particularly for picoeukaryotes (0.2–3 µm cell size). Here, we examined the picoeukaryotic communities inhabiting different vertical zones of the tropical and subtropical global ocean: surface, deep chlorophyll maximum, mesopelagic (including the deep scattering layer and oxygen minimum zones), and bathypelagic. Communities were analysed by high-tthroughput sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene (V4 region) as represented by DNA (community structure) and RNA (metabolism), followed by delineation of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at 99\% similarity. We found a stratiﬁcation of the picoeukaryotic communities along the water column, with assemblages corresponding to the sunlit and dark ocean. Speciﬁc taxonomic groups either increased (e.g., Chrysophyceae or Bicosoecida) or decreased (e.g., Dinoﬂagellata or MAST-3) in abundance with depth. We used the rRNA:rDNA ratio of each OTU as a proxy of metabolic activity. The highest relative activity was found in the mesopelagic layer for most taxonomic groups, and the lowest in the bathypelagic. Altogether, we characterize the change in community structure and metabolic activity of picoeukaryotes with depth in the global ocean, suggesting a hotspot of activity in the mesopelagic.},

Using a metabarcoding dataset of marine plankton from the global ocean, 318,054 mixotrophic metabarcodes represented by 89,951,866 sequences and belonging to 133 taxonomic lineages were identiﬁed and classiﬁed into four mixotrophic functional types: constitutive mixotrophs (CM), generalist non-constitutive mixotrophs (GNCM), endo-symbiotic specialist non-constitutive mixotrophs (eSNCM), and plastidic specialist non-constitutive mixotrophs (pSNCM). Mixotrophy appeared ubiquitous, and the distributions of the four mixotypes were analyzed to identify the abiotic factors shaping their biogeographies. Kleptoplastidic mixotrophs (GNCM and pSNCM) were detected in new zones compared to previous morphological studies. Constitutive and non-constitutive mixotrophs had similar ranges of distributions. Most lineages were evenly found in the samples, yet some of them displayed strongly contrasted distributions, both across and within mixotypes. Particularly divergent biogeographies were found within endo-symbiotic mixotrophs, depending on the ability to form colonies or the mode of symbiosis. We showed how metabarcoding can be used in a complementary way with previous morphological observations to study the biogeography of mixotrophic protists and to identify key drivers of their biogeography.},

	abstract = {Community ecology is often perceived as a “mess,” given the seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species—the subject matter of community ecology—are inﬂuenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. Selection represents deterministic ﬁtness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal, to drive community dynamics.},

Speciﬁcally, we develop a set of best practices for testing the ﬁt of the zerosum multinomial (ZSM) vs. a lognormal null hypothesis and apply this to a data set, concluding that the lognormal outperforms neutral theory on robust tests. We explore whether a priori parameterization of neutral theory is possible, and we conclude that it is not.

              To elucidate the potential importance of deep-water viruses in controlling the meso- and bathypelagic picoplankton community, the abundance, decay rate, and diversity of the virioplankton community were determined in the meso- and bathypelagic water masses of the eastern part of the subtropical North Atlantic.

              at around 100 m of depth and decreased only by a factor of 2 at 3,000 to 4,000 m of depth. In contrast, picoplankton abundance decreased by 1 order of magnitude to the Lower Deep Water (LDW; 3,500- to 5,000-m depth). The virus-to-picoplankton ratio increased from 9 at about 100 m of depth to 110 in the LDW. Mean viral decay rates were 3.5 × 10

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis fingerprints obtained from the viral community between 2,400 m and 4,000 m of depth revealed a maximum of only four bands from 4,000 m of depth. Based on the high viral abundance and the low picoplankton production determined via leucine incorporation, we conclude that the viral production calculated from the viral decay is insufficient to maintain the high viral abundance in the deep North Atlantic. Rather, we propose that substantial allochthonous viral input or lysogenic or pseudolysogenic production is required to maintain the high viral abundance detected in the meso- and bathypelagic North Atlantic. Consequently, deep-water prokaryotes are apparently far less controlled in their abundance and taxon richness by lytic prokaryotic phages than the high viral abundance and the virus-to-picoplankton ratio would suggest.},

            Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) support ocean biogeochemical cycles of global importance. The OMZ off central Chile is characterized by seasonally variable oxygen concentrations due to upwelling events. Bacterial and archaeal communities from this area have been previously described; however, picoeukaryote communities remain largely unexplored. In order to improve our knowledge on picoeukaryote ecology and the effect of controlling factors on its community structure, environmental parameters and 18S rRNA metabarcoding analyses were performed in water samples collected at several depths at a time series station on the continental shelf in March, May and August. Our results showed that oxygen, nitrate, silicate and temperature are relevant factors shaping the picoeukaryote community structure. Overall, according to our sequence dataset, the OMZ was dominated by Dinophyceae members including marine parasitic dinoflagellates. Moreover, dysoxic and suboxic conditions were enriched by fungi and phagotrophic protists from Ustilaginomycetes, Bicoecea and Choanoflagellatea. The latter is particularly relevant in the understanding of metazoan evolution and the origins of multicellularity in low-oxygen environments. Picoeukaryote communities changed significantly over the 3 months sampled with variations in water column stratification, including the occurrence of a winter bloom of Mamiellales. Altogether, this study reveals a great diversity and dynamics of picoeukaryotes inhabiting a coastal OMZ.},

Using 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and iTAG sequencing analyses of nearly 4 years of monthly sampling through the water column (5–80 m depth), we found a clear partitioning of community composition that could be attributed to dissolved oxygen (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.578) in comparison to other environmental variables, such as light, fluorescence, temperature, salinity, microbial abundance or nutrients. Bacteroidetes (orders Sphingobacteriales and Flavobacteriales), SAR11 (subclades Ia Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique and II), an unclassified group of Alphaproteobacteria, and SAR86 dominated in waters containing dissolved oxygen concentrations ≥70 μM. In contrast, taxonomic groups associated with capabilities of either oxidative or reductive cycling of inorganic sulfur dominated in waters with dissolved oxygen from {\textasciitilde}70 μM to undetectable levels. The dominant groups were Arctic96BD-19, SUP05 and SAR324 (sulfur oxidation) and Desulfobacterales (sulfate reduction). Desulfobacterales are known to come primarily from sulfidic, nitrate/nitrite-depleted waters and sediments. Their presence, therefore, provides taxonomic evidence for pelagic dissimilatory sulfate reduction within oxygen-depleted coastal environments.},
